# Foghorn

**Send pop-up alerts to Windows desktops from a web page.**

A member of staff types a message in their browser, picks who should get it
(everyone, a room, an AD group, one PC) and presses **Send alert**. A second or
two later it is on top of whatever those people are doing.

![The Foghorn web console](docs/images/console-send.png)

No cloud, no licences, no database. One server program, one small client
program, and clear documentation. Built for schools, colleges and offices on
Active Directory.

| Part | Runs on |
|---|---|
| **Server** + web console | Windows Server 2016+ / Windows 10–11, **or** 64-bit Linux with systemd |
| **Desktop client** | Windows 10 and 11 (the PCs that receive alerts) |
| **Web console** | Any modern browser, on any device |

---

## Features

- **Three styles**, so alerts fit their purpose:
  - *Corner* — a card at the top-right, above other windows, without stealing the keyboard.
  - *Centre* — the same card, larger, in the middle of the screen.
  - *Full screen* — covers every monitor. For emergencies and "eyes to the front".
- **Targeting** by computer name, logged-on user, AD organisational unit, AD group, or IP subnet. Saved groups (typically rooms) for one-click reuse.
- **Acknowledgement tracking.** Ask people to confirm they read it, and see who did.
- **Recall** — take an alert off every screen still showing it.
- **Live delivery view.** Watch, per computer, who has displayed and confirmed each alert.
- **Templates** for wording you reuse. Wording only — audience is always a deliberate choice.
- **Roles.** *Administrators* manage everything. *Senders* can send alerts, optionally limited to their own groups (a tutor to their own classroom, say). Every alert is signed with the sender's name.
- **API tokens** for scripts and monitoring systems.
- **Small.** About 40 MB of memory on the server with 1,500 PCs connected. The client is a 64 KB `.exe` and needs nothing installed on Windows 10 or 11.
- **Standard deployment.** Roll the client out with an MSI + transform through Group Policy Software Installation, Intune, SCCM, PDQ, or a start-up script.
- **No internet needed.** Console uses system fonts only. No CDN, no telemetry, no external calls.
- **HTTPS** with your own certificate. Cross-site request forgery and login lock-out are built in. Passwords are PBKDF2-SHA256 (210,000 rounds).

## Quick start (about 10 minutes)

You need a machine that stays on (a Windows server or spare PC, or a Linux
server — Foghorn uses very little of it) and one Windows test PC. The steps
below are for a Windows server; on Linux, do
[Running the server on Linux](#running-the-server-on-linux) instead of step 1,
then carry on from step 2.

**1. Install the server.** Copy this whole folder to the server. Open
PowerShell **as administrator**, go to the `deploy` folder and run:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Install-FoghornServer.ps1
```

It prints the console address, a temporary password and the **client key** —
copy them for the next few minutes.

**2. Sign in.** On any PC, open `http://YOUR-SERVER:8080/`, sign in as `admin`
with the temporary password, choose your own. Under **Settings** set your
organisation name.

**3. Try it on one PC by hand.** Copy `dist\FoghornClient.exe`,
`deploy\Install-FoghornClient.cmd` and `deploy\Install-FoghornClient.ps1` into
one folder on a test PC. From an **administrator** command prompt in that
folder:

```bat
Install-FoghornClient.cmd -ServerUrl http://YOUR-SERVER:8080 -ClientKey PASTE-THE-KEY
```

Log on as a normal user. The PC appears in **Computers** with a green dot
within a few seconds. Go to **Send an alert** and send yourself one.

**4. Roll it out to every PC.** Follow
[docs/DEPLOY-CLIENTS.md](docs/DEPLOY-CLIENTS.md) — the recommended path is an
**MSI + transform** deployed with Group Policy Software Installation.

> Want to see what alerts look like before installing anything? Open a command
> prompt in the `dist` folder on any Windows PC and run
> `FoghornClient.exe --test`. It shows one of each style without needing a
> server.

## Running the server on Linux

The server is a single static binary with no dependencies; a systemd unit is
included. On any 64-bit Linux with systemd (Ubuntu, Debian, RHEL/Rocky/Alma…),
from this folder:

```bash
sudo useradd --system --home-dir /var/lib/foghorn --shell /usr/sbin/nologin foghorn
sudo install -m 0755 dist/foghorn-server-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/foghorn-server
sudo install -m 0644 deploy/linux/foghorn.service /etc/systemd/system/foghorn.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now foghorn
sudo cat /var/lib/foghorn/FIRST-RUN.txt      # temporary admin password + client key
sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp                       # or: firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=8080/tcp && firewall-cmd --reload
```

Then continue from step 2 of the quick start. Good to know:

- **Only the server runs on Linux.** The desktop client is Windows-only; the PCs do not care what the server runs on, and AD targeting still works because the clients report their own OU and groups.
- The service runs as the unprivileged `foghorn` account in a systemd sandbox that can write only to **`/var/lib/foghorn`**. Data, `config.json` and `foghorn.log` all live there — back up that folder.
- The bundled binary is **x86-64 only**. For ARM, build from source (see [docs/BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md)).
- When running `foghorn-server` by hand (e.g. `reset-password`), always pass `-data /var/lib/foghorn` and run it as the `foghorn` user. The `service …` commands are Windows-only — use `systemctl`.
- Ports below 1024 (e.g. 443) need `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` or a reverse proxy.

HTTPS, reverse proxies, upgrading, password resets, moving between Windows and
Linux, and removal are all covered in
**[docs/INSTALL-SERVER.md — Appendix A](docs/INSTALL-SERVER.md#appendix-a-installing-on-linux)**.

## How it fits together

```

- **Clients connect out to the server.** Nothing listens on the PCs, so there are no firewall changes on them.
- Each client tells the server its computer name, logged-on user, the computer's OU and the user's AD groups. That is how targeting works — the server never talks to a domain controller directly.
- All data is JSON files in one folder — `C:\ProgramData\Foghorn` on Windows, `/var/lib/foghorn` on Linux. Backing up is copying that folder.

## Building from source

```bash
# Server (needs Go 1.22+)
cd server && go test ./... && CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -mod=vendor -trimpath -buildvcs=false -ldflags "-s -w" -o ../dist/foghorn-server.exe .

# Server for Linux (from any OS)
cd server && GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -mod=vendor -trimpath -buildvcs=false -ldflags "-s -w" -o ../dist/foghorn-server-linux-amd64 .

# Client (on Windows, uses the C# compiler that ships with Windows itself)
cd client && build.cmd

# Client MSI (on Linux, needs the wixl and msitools packages)
deploy/msi/build-msi.sh
```
